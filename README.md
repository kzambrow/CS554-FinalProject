# Installation

Begin with an installation of image magick:
https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php

# npm install concurrently
from here you should be able to 
# npm install all
then
# npm run seed
then
# npm start
and the server and client will run

if for some reason concurrently is not working, please
cd into the server folder and run "npm install", then
cd back into the root, then cd into the client folder and run "npm install",
then you should be able to cd back into the root and "npm start".
if the "npm start" still has issues due to concurrently not working, please cd into both the server and client and run 
"npm start" in both of them.
