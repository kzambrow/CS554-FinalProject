# Installation

Begin with an installation of image magick:
https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php

# npm install concurrently (in root folder)
from here you should be able to 
# npm install all (in root folder)
then
# npm run seed (in root folder)
then
# npm start (in root folder)
and the server and client will run

if for some reason concurrently is not working, please
cd into the server folder and run "npm install", you can also "npm run seed" while here, then
cd back into the root, then cd into the client folder and run "npm install",
then you should be able to cd back into the root and "npm start".
if the "npm start" still has issues due to concurrently not working, please cd into both the server and client and run 
"npm start" in both of them.

if the client does not open automatically, please go to localhost:3000
